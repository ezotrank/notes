# AWS/SQS

tags: #aws #sqs

## Highlights

- Standard queues support at-least-once message delivery, and FIFO queues support exactly-once message processing.
- Enable content-based deduplication. This instructs Amazon SQS to use a SHA-256 hash to generate the message deduplication ID using the body of the messageâ€”but not the attributes of the message. For more information, see the documentation on the CreateQueue, GetQueueAttributes, and SetQueueAttributes actions in the Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference.
-  If you retry the SendMessage action within the 5-minute deduplication interval, Amazon SQS doesn't introduce any duplicates into the queue.
- Standard queue - At-Least-Once delivery.
- FIFO queue - Exactly Once delivery.
